# Simple-SoftEngine

A simple soft engine for rendering 3d objects.

  I learnt the Tutorial series: learning how to write a 3D soft engine from scratch in C#, TypeScript or JavaScript 
at https://www.davrous.com/2013/06/13/tutorial-series-learning-how-to-write-a-3d-soft-engine-from-scratch-in-c-typescript-or-javascript/
 and implement my own version in c++.
  
However, my c++ is so dirty because time I spent in learning it is so dirty.So, my code maybe is not good enough.
  Dependencies: sfml-2.4.1 in dll folder.
